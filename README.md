# Smart-Contact-Book (Java OOP)

ðŸ“Œ Description
This Smart Contact Book is a console-based Java application designed to manage contacts effectively. It allows users to add, update, delete, search, and view contacts. Additionally, it organizes contacts, checks for duplicates, and saves the data for future access. This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

ðŸŽ¯ Features

-âœ… Contact Management: Add, update, delete, and search contacts.
-âœ… Data Organization: Sort contacts by name and view them alphabetically.
-âœ… Data Integrity: Detects duplicate contacts and handles errors gracefully.
-âœ… File Management: Save and load contacts to and from a file for persistent storage.

âœ… OOP Concepts Used

-âœ… Encapsulation: Contact details are kept private and can only be accessed via getter and setter methods.
-âœ… Inheritance: Used for creating different types of contacts (e.g., family, work).
-âœ… Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding are used to perform various operations on contacts with different parameters.
-âœ… Abstraction: Hides complex logic like file handling and contact management, providing a simple interface for users.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

-âœ… Programming Language: Java
-âœ… IDE: NetBeans
-âœ… File Handling: Java File I/O for saving and loading contact data
-âœ… Database: No external database is used; file system stores contact data

ðŸ“‹ How to Run the Project
https://github.com/jubairahmed0/Smart-Contact-Book

ðŸ“‚Using the Application:
Add a new contact with name, phone number, and email.
Update or delete existing contacts.
Search for a contact by name or other details.
Sort and view contacts in alphabetical order.
Save and load your contacts using the file system.

ðŸ“‚ File Handling Details
Contact Data is stored in a .dat file located in the data/ folder.
The application loads contact data at startup and saves any changes when the program ends.

ðŸ”§ Future Enhancements
Add more contact fields (e.g., address, birthday).
Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing for easier interaction.
Add more advanced sorting options (e.g., by phone number, email).
Implement encryption for better data security.
